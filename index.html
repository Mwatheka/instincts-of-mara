          <h2>Masai Mara Sundowners</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Founded during the days of the great game-<b>hunting Masai Mara safaris</b> of the 1920's, the sundowner marked the point at which, the day’s hunting over, a fire would be lit, camp-chairs laid out and elegant cocktails served by white-gloved waiters. The scene set; the highlights of the day could then be discussed as the hunting party watched the sun make its regal descent. Today, the hunting days are long gone, but the tradition of the sundowner lives on. On the equator, the sun begins its descent at roughly the same time all the year round – between five and six pm. For the perfect sundowner experience, therefore, you’ll set out with your driver/guide in the late afternoon. This is the perfect time for a game drive: the heat has gone out of the sun; the air is fresh and the light is beginning to turn its trademark gold – it’s known as ‘magic light’ and is the ideal time for photography. This is also the optimum time to catch the wildlife as it emerges into the cool of the evening. Now is the time to see the hyenas on the prowl, the zebra in their dust baths, the hippo as they emerge from the river. Now is the moment when you might be lucky enough to encounter a family of cheetah. Or even to come across our local leopard and her beautiful cub. At <b>Instincts of Mara</b>, we have an excellent selection of sundowner spots, each of which has its own particular charm – all of which are panoramic. Arriving at your destination, stools will be laid out, a safari bar will be whisked out of the back of your vehicle, delicious ‘bitings’ will be served, and you can settle down for the sun set. It’s quite a show. Sinking in a huge mango-pink ball, the sun drops slowly behind the grey-blue of the escarpment. The sky turns every shade of lilac-grey until all that is left is a soft pink glow punctuated by great shafts of silver. And on the horizon, the zebra stand out in soft silhouette.

          <h2>Olderkesi Conservancy</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            The Olderkesi Conservancy is a 7600-acre piece of land set aside by the Olderkesi Community as a Conservation area in southern Kenya, immediately adjacent to the southeastern boundary of the Maasai Mara National Reserve (MMNR) and on the border with Tanzania. Olderkesi Conservancy is part of the greater Serengeti – Maasai Mara Ecosystem, crossing into Tanzania and covering approximately 30,000 km2 The particular piece of land that the <b>Olderkesi Conservancy occupies</b> is vitally important to the greater ecosystem and comprises multiple types of habitats, including grasslands, riverine valleys, forests, and woodlands. It’s a haven for many species of wildlife, not to mention a route for the great wildebeest migration. It’s also home to the Maasai – a very independent people who still value tradition and ritual as part of their everyday lives. Historically, the Maasai are semi-nomadic pastoralists, placing huge importance on their herds of cattle, but also living alongside wildlife in harmony, with lions and wildebeest playing an important role in their cultural beliefs. Olderkesi is one of the last of the communal areas to undergo sub-division in the Mara region, as mandated by the Government. The <b>Olderkesi Group Ranch</b> has 6,650 members who represent the head of each family and jointly own the Conservancy through the Olderkesi Community Wildlife Trust. The <b>Cottars Wildlife Conservation Trust</b> (CWCT) has been working in partnership with Secluded Africa Wildlife and Community Trust (SAWCT) and the greater Olderkesi Community to secure this important ecological landscape and to improve the lives of the community members. To date, the tourism partners have collected lease fees on behalf of the community and supported the community through projects that have included building schools and bridges, providing medical and ambulance services, employing security scouts from the community, building water troughs for cattle, providing bursaries, the establishment of environmental clubs, and Human Wildlife Conflict mitigation efforts. In return, the leased land is to be left alone, free of settlements, farming, and uncontrolled domestic livestock grazing and exists to create safe habitat and passage for wildlife. In addition to managing the Olderkesi Conservancy, we aim to scale up the area under conservation by leasing strategic areas within the Olderkesi Group Ranch from landowners and managing the new areas on their behalf.

          <h2>Masai Mara National Reserve</h2>
          <p style="text-align:justify;">
             The <b>Masai Mara National Reserve</b> and its neighboring conservancies form Kenya’s flagship conservation area and is one of the finest wildlife and safari destinations in Africa. The Masai Mara is made up of Maasai Mara National Reserve, the Mara Triangle, and several smaller conservancies. The main Masai Mara National Reserve is managed by the Narok County Government and is around 1000 km², it is separated from the smaller, privately managed Mara Triangle, by the Mara River. The main reserve has four main entry gates – Oloolaimutia, Sekenani, Talek, and Musiara and the Mara Triangle’s main entry gate is Oloololo.  Located in south west Kenya, the Masai Mara National Reserve is renowned for its vast scenic expanse of gently rolling African savannah plains, measuring approximately 1510 square kilometers in area, bordering the notorious Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the south. The Masai Mara’s sprawling wide-open plains provide a sanctuary for its abundant wildlife to freely roam the vast Masai Mara wilderness and beyond. The legendary Masai Mara is also the site of the iconic Great Migration in Africa – also known as the Gnu Migration, Serengeti Migration and Masai Mara Migration. The annual Great Migration is one of the chief reasons why so many travelers venture to Kenya, Tanzania, and the Masai Mara for a Migration safari. The iconic Masai Mara Great Migration includes millions of wildebeest, accompanied by large numbers of zebra, and smaller numbers of Grant’s gazelle, Thomson’s gazelle, eland, and impala venture across the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem moving from the Masai Mara National Reserve to Tanzania Serengeti National Park. Proclaimed one of the greatest wildlife spectacles and remarkable natural wonders in the world – Witnessing and experiencing the Masai Mara Great Migration should undoubtedly be on everyone’s African safari travel bucket-list. Besides its spectacular wildlife spectacles and seasonal highlights, the Masai Mara National Reserve is not only deemed one of the most prestigious and unique wildlife conservation havens in Africa, famed for its remarkable natural diversity of wildlife and birdlife, it is one of the most prominent and premier Kenyan safari locations in East Africa, offering visitors and game and nature enthusiasts alike an authentic, one-of-a-kind, and unforgettable African safari experience. Voted one of the new Seven Wonders of the World and famously declared a top, not-to-be-missed, bucket-list worthy African safari and wildlife destination, its no surprise avid travelers, keen adventurers and explorers, globe trotters, and eager wildlife and nature enthusiasts travel from around the globe to experience all of the Masai Mara’s wilderness wonders and safari adventures first-hand.

              <b>August – September</b> is when the famous Mara River crossings happen as the herds hunt for fresh, greener pastures in the northern Serengeti and in the Masai Mara in Kenya.

          <h2>Mara River Crossings</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            The Mara River crossings are known as the ‘biggest event’ of the entire migration of the wildebeest. Travelers will never forget this life-or-death experience of baby wildebeest and their mothers fighting for their lives, as they attempt to cross the famous Mara River and confront the starving crocodiles. Watching the herds blindly jump into the river is spectacular, to say the least, as they face over 3,000 crocodiles that lurk in the murky waters of the Mara River. The wildebeest that successfully cross the Mara River are rewarded with the green grass; however, they still face threats of the big cats prowling on the plains of the Masai Mara. The Mara River, sometimes known as the 'river of death,' is 395 kilometres long and has a surface area of 13,504 km squared. The river starts in the Kenyan highlands of Narok county and flows through the Masai Mara national reserve's grasslands to the northern Serengeti in Tanzania before draining into Lake Victoria, the Nile's main reservoir.  There are various crossing points along the Mara River, with different large herds crossing at different points.  
          </p>
          <h2>When to see a river crossing</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Although the migration usually occurs from July to October, it is difficult to determine exactly when the wildebeest will cross the Mara River until the vast herds have congregated near the Masai Mara national reserve on the Serengeti's northern side. Even once the herds have congregated, they can stand on the edge of the Mara River for several days until one brave wildebeest, quite literally, takes the plunge. The crossing usually starts mid-July to late August, keeping in mind this is a gradual event that takes place over several weeks at different locations along the Serengeti/Masai Mara border. The return journey back to the Serengeti happens in late October, however, this is less of a spectacular event as it is more of a slow dispersal. 
          </p>
          <h2>Best places to stay</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            If you are specifically looking to see a Mara River crossing, we would recommend staying in the main Masai Mara Reserve, although it is worth noting that this can get busy during peak time. Staying in a conservancy is a quieter option and although a little further from the ‘main’ action, there are no fences so the animals move freely, and you can still take a trip into the main national reserve if you want to. Many of the camps in conservancies are on rivers so you can see a river crossing, it may just not be as dramatic as those crossing the Mara River.
          </p>
          <h2>Why visit Masai Mara?</h2>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <b>Close your eyes and envision</b> a gentle rolling savannah stretching out as far as the eye can see. Imagine countless wildebeest and zebras grazing lazily right there in front of you. The feeling is humbling and inspiring all wrapped into one. The Masai Mara is known for the highest concentration of wild animals in the world. More than 40% of Africa’s larger mammals can be found here. However, there’s more to the Masai Mara than endless plains. Aside from the main Masai Mara National Reserve proper there are a dozen community conservancies, several group ranches and quite a few Maasai villages in the area.
