Acacia trees, rising waters, fresh crisp air and scenic views are what define Elementaita. If you are looking to break the monotony of a daily routine, then consider retreating to the place. Group activities would also thrive here, so feel free to tag a team with you, or simply go on a solo trip and enjoy quality time rejuvenating.  You can get to Elementaita via air transport, using the airstrip at Naivasha then drive to the place, or simply use road transport as you take in the stunning views along the way.

            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Understanding the best time to visit Kenya is important as this will impact accommodation, flight prices, availability and the weather that visitors can expect on their safari vacation.
