          <p style="text-align:justify;">
            Lake Elmenteita is a soda lake in the eastern sweep of the Kenyan Rift Valley, which lies approximately 120 km northwest of Nairobi, Kenya. The lake covers a surface area of 18 sq. km and lies at an elevation of 1,670 meters in the shadow of an imposingly peaked hill locally known as the <b>Sleeping Maasai</b>. Located in the Rift Valley, between <b>Lake Naivasha</b> and <b>Lake Nakuru</b> lies this epitome of beauty, the perfect spot for an out-of-town kind of escapade. Acacia trees, rising waters, fresh crisp air and scenic views are what define Elementaita. If you are looking to break the monotony of a daily routine, then consider retreating to the place. Group activities would also thrive here, so feel free to tag a team with you, or simply go on a solo trip and enjoy quality time rejuvenating.  You can get to Elementaita via air transport, using the airstrip at Naivasha then drive to the place, or simply use road transport as you take in the stunning views along the way. Below are some places to visit in Elementaita, and the respective fun activities to engage in.

The lake is approximately one and a half-hour drive from Nairobi. The airstrip in Naivasha provides charter flights. The guesthouses and lodges in the expanse can organize transport from Nairobi to Naivasha. If you plan to make a day trip to Lake Elmenteita from Lake Nakuru National Park, the easiest way is to leave the park through Nderit Gate, beyond Lake Nakuru Lodge. This track dies at the D320, which runs southward (right), heading for Elmenteita town, where it joins the D321.

Apart from the incredible views overlooking the lake, visitors enjoy going on guided game drives, both at day and night time where they can visit numerous bird hides (shelters) watching the amazing flamingo and other birds in action, as well as near the watering holes. Safari-goers can also experience fresh and flavourful Kenyan bush dining experience at Lake Elmenteita in a dining tent or terrace with lake views enjoying a delicious sundowner cocktail in a most tranquil setting. Lake Elementaita is home to over 400 bird species including the famous flamingos and for that reason, it is a protected area to help conserve the birdlife on the lake plus the lake is listed as a UNESCO heritage site so it needs to be protected. Lake Elementaita is also a Ramsar site. The variety of birds found on Lake Elementaita include but not limited to: Ducks, geese, spikes, cormorant, kingfishers, Montane white-eye, Northern puffback, Pallid harrier, Red-capped lark, pelicans, Rufous-throated wryneck and Long-tailed widowbird. 18 sq km in size and lying in the <b>Soysambu conservancy</b> which covers about 2 thirds of Lake Elementeita shorelines and harbours about 10,000 mammals that include the Rothschild giraffe, herons, leopards, bush pigs, jackals, Elands, gazelles, zebras and others.

            <h2>Best time to go to Lake Elmenteita</h2>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">
                Understanding the best time to visit Kenya is important as this will impact accommodation, flight prices, availability and the weather that visitors can expect on their safari vacation. Elementaita is a wondrous location to visit anytime during the year, but we recommend that you visit during the dry seasons that occur from July to October, January and February.
